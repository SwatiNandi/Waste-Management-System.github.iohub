### Hello, I'm Swati👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### **Waste Management System**  

**OVERVIEW:** 
1.Inefficient Garbage Collection:
* Fixed truck routes lead to missed pickups and overfilled bins.
* Increased fuel, time, and labor costs due to non-optimized routes.
2.Manual Waste Sorting:
* High error rates in sorting recyclables and non-recyclables.
* Labor-intensive and costly process with low recycling efficiency.
3.Environmental Impact:
* More waste sent to landfills, increasing pollution and landfill use.
* Higher carbon footprint from inefficient waste collection and transportation.
4.Higher Costs:
* Increased operational costs for waste collection and disposal.
* Loss of valuable recyclable resources and higher waste management expenses.
  
**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:** 

1. Environmental Impact
Reduces air, water, and soil pollution.
Conserves natural resources through recycling.
Minimizes greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.
Protects biodiversity by reducing habitat destruction.
2. Economic Impact
Lowers costs of waste disposal and environmental cleanup.
Generates employment in recycling and waste processing industries.
Recovers valuable resources, creating additional revenue.
3. Social Impact
Improves public health by minimizing exposure to hazardous waste.
Promotes community awareness and involvement in sustainable practices.
Ensures cleaner, healthier living environments.
4. Global Impact
Mitigates climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Encourages a circular economy, reusing waste as a resource.
5. Challenges
Lack of public awareness and participation.
Insufficient infrastructure and technology.
Resistance to adopting new policies or systems.
Conclusion
A well-implemented waste management system ensures environmental protection, economic benefits, and improved societal well-being, making it crucial for sustainable development.
